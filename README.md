The project consist of two phases:
- *Data Processing* using PowerQuery.
- *Data Visualization*: Dashboard presentation using Excel.

The whole project can be found in the same [Excel workbook](https://github.com/maurodv09/Coffe-Production/blob/main/Coffe_project.xlsx)

*Detailed documentacion of the steps taken in the data processing phase can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/maurodv09/Coffe-Production/blob/main/Data-Processing-Documentation.md)
