# Global-Coffee-Insights
This project aims to explore historic data from all countries that produce coffee, focusing on three main aspects: **Production**, **Consumption**, and **Export**. Primarily, this project will use data visualizations to present the findings in an compelling and comprehensible manner.

The project consist of two phases:
- *Data Processing* using PowerQuery.
- *Data Visualization*: Dashboard presentation using Excel.

The whole project can be found in the same [Excel workbook](https://github.com/maurodv09/Global-Coffee-Insights/blob/main/Coffe_project.xlsx)

*Detailed documentacion of the steps taken in the data processing phase can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/maurodv09/Global-Coffee-Insights/blob/main/Data-Processing-Documentation.md)
